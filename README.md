# edhData
This is a program to store data from my EDH group's Commander games in Magic: The Gathering.  We are trying to collect data for a whole year in order to find out some stuff about our decks and about us.

Things we want to know:  
Who plays the most games?  
Who plays the fewest games?  
Which deck is played most?  
Who wins most often?  
Who loses most often?  
Which deck has the highest win rate?  
Which deck has the lowest win rate?  
Who has the most fun?  
Who has the least fun?  
Which deck is the most fun?  
Which deck is the least fun?  
Which deck is the most fun to play against?  
Which deck is the least fun to play against?
